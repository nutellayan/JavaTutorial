# <ins>My University Work - Learning Java</ins>:grinning:

This repository contains code for my university course on Java programming. The code covers various fundamental concepts of Java, including:

**Unit 1** - Introduction to Programming: Provides an introduction to the core principles of programming, including variables, data types, operators, and basic program structure.

**Unit 2** - Flow of Control: Explores techniques for controlling the flow of execution within a program, using conditional statements (if/else, switch) and loops (while, for).

**Unit 3** - Loops: Delves deeper into different types of loops (while, for, do-while) and their applications for repetitive tasks.

**Unit 4** - Arrays: Introduces arrays as collections of data elements of the same type, enabling efficient storage and manipulation of data sets.

**Unit 5** - Methods: Explains how to create reusable blocks of code called methods, promoting code modularity and organization.

**Unit 6** - Workbook: May contain practice exercises or projects to solidify your understanding of the covered concepts.

**Unit 7** - Introduction to Objects: Provides a foundational understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like objects, classes, and inheritance.
